    <div class="hero-card">
      <p>This page explains how Soviet Cold War posters used symbols, slogans, and composition to shape public opinion and oppose the United States. Each section gives a concise historical summary tying visual elements to the political contest with the U.S. and the broader Cold War narrative.</p>
    </div>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>Soviet economic posters commonly celebrated industrial production, collective farms, and planned growth by showing heroic workers, overflowing harvests, and bold tools — visual shorthand for stability and progress under socialism; these images were meant to contrast the USSR's collective achievements with American capitalism, implying that the United States suffered inequality and instability while Soviet planning delivered abundance and dignity to ordinary people.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="politics">
      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p>Political posters emphasized unity, the Communist Party's leadership, and the moral righteousness of socialism by using strong, geometric composition, red banners, and portraits of party leaders or workers; such imagery reinforced the legitimacy of Soviet institutions and framed the U.S. as an ideological rival whose democracy was portrayed as corrupt or imperialist, turning complex geopolitical conflict into a moral story of collective virtue versus capitalist greed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Education-themed posters presented schooling, literacy campaigns, and youth organizations as engines of social transformation, often showing children or students engaged in science and reading beneath slogans about learning for the motherland; by linking schooling to civic duty and technical skill these visuals argued that Soviet education produced responsible citizens and skilled workers who would outpace their American counterparts in knowledge and loyalty.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="military">
      <h2>Military and Defense</h2>
      <p>Defense-focused posters combined images of disciplined soldiers, patriotic mass mobilization, and protective machinery to cultivate readiness and pride; these works framed military strength as necessary for defending socialism against imperialist threats from the West, using stark contrasts and confident slogans to reassure citizens that Soviet power and vigilance were the best guarantee of peace and independence in opposition to perceived U.S. aggression.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="space">
      <h2>Space and Technology</h2>
      <p>Space race posters celebrated scientific achievement and cosmic ambition by depicting rockets, engineers, and triumphant cosmonauts as symbols of modernity and global leadership; by claiming technological firsts the USSR used visual triumph to challenge American prestige, portraying Soviet socialism as the system that could advance humanity and win the future rather than merely compete in military or economic arenas.</p>
